              All tiers include 5 props and dialouge. Tier 1 includes a single character in a single pose with no background. Each piece uses a five-color palette for visual consistency. Prices range from $70 to $120 depending on character complexity.

              All tiers include 5 props and dialouge. Tier 2 features a single cohesive scene with two characters, perfect for interaction or storytelling moments. Tier 3 includes up to four connected scenes, allowing for more narrative depth. Tier 3 also supports complex character dynamics and story progression.

              Yes! Each additional character is $80 per character for Tier 2 and $100 per character in Tier 3 due to the extra complexity. Please include full character details when requesting your commission.

              Yes, simple props are free, and custom backgrounds can be added for an additional cost depending on complexity. Tier 1 focuses on characters only, while Tier 2 and 3 allow for environmental elements.

              Turnaround time depends on the tier and complexity. Tier 1 pieces generally take 1–2 weeks, Tier 2 takes 2–4 weeks, and Tier 3 may take up to 6 weeks. You’ll receive timeline updates via email or telegram after purchase. After six months, clients may request a full refund. Any digital commission in progress will be delivered in its current state at the discretion of BadRobbie Studios.

              All commissions are for personal use only unless a commercial license is purchased separately. Commercial use includes merchandise, promotional content, or resale of the artwork.

              Minor revisions are included during the sketch phase. Major changes or post-completion edits may incur additional fees depending on complexity. Please review sketches carefully before approval.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">
            What is considered a big vs. small revision?
            <span class="arrow">▼</span>

              Revisions should remain within the scope of the original concept. Small adjustments like color tweaks or pose refinement are allowed, but complete redesigns or significant composition changes may be treated as a new commission.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
              <strong>Sketch Phase:</strong><br>
              During the sketch phase, clients may request major changes such as a new pose, composition shift, or a fresh sketch entirely. This is the ideal time for large adjustments, as the artwork is still in early development.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Line Art Phase:</strong><br>
              Once the artwork enters the line art phase, the structure becomes locked in. At this stage, revisions are limited to minor refinements, such as adjusting proportions or small details.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Color Phase:</strong><br>
              After moving into the color phase, only color-based revisions are allowed. The line art cannot be changed once coloring has begun.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Final Detailing & Dialogue Stage:</strong><br>
              During the final detailing and dialogue stage, the artwork is near completion, and no additional revisions can be accommodated.
            </p>
