            Welcome to the BadRobbie Art Menu. By accessing or using this website, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, please do not use this site or its services.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Overview</h3>
          <p class="tier-desc">
            BadRobbie Studios operates a virtual art commission price menu (“the Site”) that provides information about available art tiers, pricing, and examples. All artworks are commissioned directly through the artist, and all prices are subject to change based on project complexity and availability.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Commissions and Payment</h3>
          <p class="tier-desc">
            Commissions are accepted at the artist’s discretion. Payment is required before work begins unless otherwise agreed in writing. All prices are listed in USD and include taxes. Additional fees may apply for extra characters, scene complexity, or commercial use rights.
          </p>
          <p class="note">*All payments are final once the commissioned work has begun.</p>
           <p class="note">*Special two payment installment plans are possible at customer's request.</p>

          <h3>3. Refunds and Revisions</h3>
          <p class="tier-desc">
            Refunds are available only before work has begun. Once sketching or design work starts, refunds cannot be issued. Minor revisions are allowed during the sketching phase. Significant changes or post-completion edits may incur additional charges. After six months, clients may request a full refund. Any digital commission in progress will be delivered in its current state at the discretion of BadRobbie Studios.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Intellectual Property & Usage Rights</h3>
          <p class="tier-desc">
            All commissioned artworks remain the intellectual property of BadRobbie Studios and the respective artist unless otherwise stated. Clients receive a personal-use license only. Commercial usage, redistribution, or NFT minting without prior written consent is prohibited.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Digital Goods Disclosure</h3>
          <p class="tier-desc">
            All products and commissions are delivered digitally via email or secure file transfer. No physical goods are shipped. By purchasing, you acknowledge receipt of a digital good and waive the right to chargeback or dispute based on non-delivery of physical products.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p class="tier-desc">
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, BadRobbie Studios shall not be held liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Site or commissioned works. The Site and its content are provided “as is” without warranties of any kind.
          </p>
